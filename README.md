# Population Analysis from 2000-2023: Exploring Global Demographics

In this project, I analyzed global population data from 2000 to 2023, focusing on male, female, and total populations for various countries. Here's how I approached the task:

1. **Data Collection & Integration:** I started with three separate datasets for male, female, and total population. Using MS Excel, I merged these datasets to create a unified view of the population by gender and total figures.     

2. **Data Cleaning with Excel Power Query:** I utilized Excel Power Query to handle inconsistencies, remove duplicates, Pivot and Unpivot columns across the dataset. This streamlined the process and prepared the data for further analysis.     

3. **Analysis in Jupyter Notebook:** After cleaning the data, I loaded it into Jupyter Notebook for analysis. Using Python libraries such as pandas,Seaborn and matplotlib, I conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in population growth, gender distribution, and demographic changes over time.       

# Male Population Trends (2000-2023) Across Countries
This analysis tracks the male population trends across the years 2000, 2015, and 2023, highlighting the global shifts in demographic dynamics.

China > India > USA > Indonesia > Brazil > Pakistan > Russia > Bangladesh > Japan > Nigeria   

**2. Top 10 Countries by Male Population - Year 2015**       
China > India > USA > Indonesia > Pakistan > Brazil > Nigeria > Bangladesh > Russia > Japan  

**3. Top 10 Countries by Male Population - Year 2023**        
India > China > USA > Indonesia > Pakistan > Nigeria > Brazil > Bangladesh > Russia > Japan

# Female Population Trends (2000-2023) Across Countries
This analysis tracks the Female population trends across the years 2000, 2015, and 2023, highlighting the global shifts in demographic dynamics.

**1. Top 10 Countries by Female Population - Year 2000**    
China > India > USA > Indonesia > Brazil > Russia > Pakistan > Japan  > Bangladesh > Nigeria  

**2. Top 10 Countries by Female Population - Year 2015**      
China > India > USA > Indonesia  > Brazil > Pakistan > Nigeria > Bangladesh > Russia > Japan      

**3. Top 10 Countries by Female Population - Year 2023**       
India > China > USA > Indonesia > Pakistan > Nigeria > Brazil > Bangladesh > Russia > Japan

# Total Population Trends (2000-2023) Across Countries
This analysis tracks the Total population trends across the years 2000, 2015, and 2023, highlighting the global shifts in demographic dynamics.

**1. Top 10 Countries by Total Population - Year 2000**         
China > India > USA > Indonesia > Brazil > Pakistan > Russia > Bangladesh  > Japan > Nigeria         

**2. Top 10 Countries by Total Population - Year 2015**        
China > India > USA > Indonesia > Pakistan > Brazil  > Nigeria > Bangladesh > Russia > Japan             

**3. Top 10 Countries by Total Population - Year 2023**            
India > China > USA > Indonesia > Pakistan > Nigeria > Brazil > Bangladesh > Russia > Japan      

# Bottom 10 least populated countries over the years 2000 - 2023 
Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau, British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar, San Marino, Turks and Caicos Islands, St. Martin (French part), Monaco, Sint Maarten (Dutch part).

# Key Observations
1. **Nigeria's and Pakistan's Surge:** Nigeriaâ€™s population saw a remarkable rise, moving from 10th in 2000 to 6th in 2023, and Pakistan's from  7th in 2000 to 5th in 2023 reflecting rapid population growth.
2. **Brazil, Russia, Japan Stagnation:** While other countries experienced significant population increases, Brazil, Russia, and Japan displayed relatively slower growth rates, hinting at demographic challenges.
3. **India's Growth:** India surpassed China by 2023, becoming the country with the largest population, driven by consistent growth over the two decades.
4. **Bottom 10 least populated countries :** These countries all have population of less than 50000, with very low growth rates over the years.

# Interpretation of Distribution Curve
1. The majority of the countries in the dataset have smaller populations, as indicated by the peak in the lower range.
2. A smaller number of countries have very large populations, as shown by the tail extending to the right.
3. There are more countries with a slightly higher female population than male, as suggested by the red curve peaking slightly earlier.
